MiPomodoro
======

One of the first WPF projects of me. I am more of a webdeveloper, but since I like the  [Pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/). All other timers were insufficient, so I'd decided to write my own and put it up on GitHub.

Pomodoro technique

If you have not heared of it yet, please download and read [the book](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/book.html) and download this free timer.

Why should I use this Pomodoro timer?
----------

Well, because it is linked to [ToDoIst](http://todoist.com). If you do not know ToDoIst, you can use it to "Get Things Done". 
Todoist is the leading personal task manager that's useful, fast and easy to use. Check out this video on YouTube which introduces ToDoIst.
